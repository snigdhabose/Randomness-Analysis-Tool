# Random Generator Test 🎲📊

<p>
A simple C++ project to test the randomness of a generator and estimate the value of π using Euclid's Algorithm for GCD.

## Overview

This project generates an array of random integers and calculates the probability that the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of randomly chosen pairs is 1. The estimation of π is then derived from this probability using the formula: π ≈ √(6 * (N/2) / Count), where N is the array size.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/snigdhab7/Testing_Random_Generator.git
    ```

2. Import the project into your preferred C++ IDE.

3. Build and run the file. [Link to Random Generator Test Code File](https://github.com/snigdhab7/Testing_Random_Generator/blob/master/8.5_Solution/8.5_Solution/sol.cpp)

4. The console will display the estimated value of π based on the random generator.
